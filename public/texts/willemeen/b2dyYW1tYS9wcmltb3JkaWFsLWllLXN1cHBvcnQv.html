			<p>**PRIMORDIAL **<br>Long-running, Dublin, Ireland-based Pagan metallers PRIMORDIAL will released their tenth full-length, How It Ends, last September via Metal Blade Records.</p><p>PRIMORDIAL has nothing to prove. Having lasted thirty-two years and now returning with their devastating new studio offering, the Irish band has made it clear they are a primal force who consistently lay it all on the line. The follow-up to 2018’s critically lauded Exile Amongst The Ruins, How It Ends sees them delivering more of their seminal blend of Celtic and black metal, with an extra added urgency, and staring down the apocalypse.</p><p>“The title is a question – is this how it ends? How it all goes down: culture, language, history, society – humanity – who knows?,” says vocalist A. A. Nemtheanga. “Regardless of who you are or were, you get one chance at all of this, and it’s asking is this the end of your town, state, nation? Myths, traditions, relationships, and I suppose it asks the question, who reacts, who rebels – how does it end now for them?“</p><p>PRIMORDIAL never plans out a record beforehand, letting them come together naturally, though Nemtheanga knew he wanted something with a bigger, more open sound, and something more aggressive, which is exactly what they achieved. “How It Ends is a very angry, defiant, visceral, and rebellious album, and as we worked it all began to take more shape and form itself. It may be the note we go out on but it will be a note of resistance, in musical terms. I think it’s also more metal! And more epic!“</p><p>**ALVADER **<br>Alvader is a Dutch group of pagan metal veterans forging music in praise of their gods, ancestors, and natural surroundings.</p><p>Featuring (ex-)members of <strong>Heidevolk, :NODFYR: and Thronar</strong> among others, Alvader started as a solo project founded by vocalist Joris in 2020 until it became a full band in 2023 with the addition of Ernstjan (vocals, bass), Kevin (guitar), Reamon (guitar), and Nico (drums).</p><p>Alvader is based in Arnhem, Gelderland, the Netherlands.</p>			</div>
