				<p>After a long time of silence, KWIJT makes its powerful return with a night that brings back the raw, unfiltered sound—now with a harder edge. We’re turning up the intensity, bringing deeper, heavier beats and a more uncompromising underground energy. This is the techno that first defined us, only now it’s stronger, more intense, and unapologetic.</p><p>We’re back at Willemeen, the venue where it all began, and where our most intimate, unforgettable nights took place. This is a night that stays true to our roots, while striving for a harder, more relentless sound.</p><p>Lineup to be announced next week.</p>
