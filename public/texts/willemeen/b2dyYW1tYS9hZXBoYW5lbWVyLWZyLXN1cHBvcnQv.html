            <strong>Aephanemer</strong><br />Integrating elements of melodic
            death metal, classical symphonies and Slavic traditional music, the
            southern French band Aephanemer have developed a sound that could
            likely influence a whole new generation of metal. After bursting
            onto the scene in 2014 with their debut EP Know Thyself, followed by
            their first and critically acclaimed full-length Memento Mori in
            2016, the four-piece quickly began growing a loyal fanbase –
            ultimately laying the foundations of the symphonic melodic death
            metal genre.

            Due in part to their deft musicality, impressive live performances
            (including at festivals like Wacken Open Air) and fresh, modern
            sound, the band quickly gained the attention of leading rock and
            metal label Napalm Records, who re-released Aephanemer's sophomore
            album, Prokopton, in October 2019. With the release of their new
            album 'A Dream of Wilderness', mixed by the legendary Dan Swanö and
            mastered by Mika Jussila from the prestigious Finnvox Studios,
            Aephanemer intends to establish itself as one of the leaders of the
            symphonic melodic death metal genre.
