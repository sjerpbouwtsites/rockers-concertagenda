			<p>**Revelation HiFi Sound System (FR) **(6 scoops)</p><p>Revelation HiFi Sound System is founded by 3 childhood friends, the love for reggae brought them together since the mid-'90s, they are animated by the sessions in England and the record collection. It was natural that in 2002, after having attended several Sound Systems such as those of Jah Shaka, Aba Shanti, Channel One UK, Jah Observer and others, the decision was made to build a Sound System that would be able to broadcast all the vibrations of this music in the traditional way.</p><p>For many years, Revelation HiFi has had the pleasure of collaborating with other Sound Systems such as Cultural warrior, Tribe works, Chalice, Jah garden, Roots Meditation, livication corner, Jahspora, Downtown, Nyabin, Coptic sound... but also to evolve alongside singers/Dee jay's like: Idren Natural, Jah Tool, Fu step, Mykha, Sister Charlotte, Peter Youthman, Brother Iko... there is also a producer who released two records on the label livication corner (Roubaix) and black redemption (usa) and who makes the dubplates for the sound</p><p>Come and feel the vibes!!!!!!</p><p><strong>Food Bass Shelter (NL)</strong></p><p>Food Bass Shelter (the basic needs in life) is a reggae soundsystem from The Hague founded in 2013 which mainly consists of Iskander and Serge. Sessions with the soundsystem. are always made possible with the helpful hands of many good friends and family. We share the love for quality vinyl and choose to play a wide variety, from roots, digital to stepper and some dubplates. As long as it has a serious message and distinct sound in the tune. Sufferation and oppression, with a heavyweight-positive vibration.</p><p><strong>Sister Marlou (NL) Clarinet, Flute, Melodica</strong><br>Sister Marlou from Arnhem Netherlands I started playing instruments from a very young age like : tin whistle, guitar, clarinet and later on also melodica. In 2015 i learned about and got in contact with reggae and dub music it was an instant love. In 2015 a 7" with Paul Fox called Truly Unique was the first. Afther that i played on dour festival in combination with Afrikan Simba and Murray Man and i visited other dubsessions. Also a 12" with murray man - Mellow vibes is in the recordshops. Unity is a message i want to share.</p>			</div>
