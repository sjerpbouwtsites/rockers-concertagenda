            is coming like a Tsunami and will smash your ears after a few
            seconds. Nasty Blastbeats, heavy grooves and sick slams combined

            Stillbirth from Hagen / Germany was founded in 1999 by former
            Guitarist (now Vocals) Lukas Swiaczny and plays a mix of Death
            Metal, Grindcore and Deathcore. Or like we call it „Brutal Surf
            Death Metal“. Stillbirth is also famous for playing live with their
            own branded swim shorts.

            SOULBURN<br />Originally SOULBURN emerged after a first demise of
            Dutch death metal legend Asphyx in the mid 90’s, when founding
            members Eric Daniels (guitars) and Bob Bagchus (drums) looked for a
            seperate outlet to unleash their mutual obsession with Bathory and
            Venom. After a demo and the cult “Feeding On Angels” debut album via
            Century Media Records in 1998, which featured Wannes Gubbels
            (Pentacle) on vocals/bass, SOULBURN were put to rest when Asphyx
            returned with “On The Wings Of Inferno” (2000) with the same
            line-up. SOULBURN was dead, buried, but not forgotten...

            DEVOURED ELYSIUM<br />Devoured Elysium is a Sci-Fi Slam Metal band
            renowned for their aggressive sound and thematic depth, drawing
            inspiration from alien invasions and futuristic dystopias. Emerging
            from the vibrant metal scene, the band made a significant impact
            with their debut album, Extermination Policies, released in 2020
            under Coyote Records.

            TEETHGRINDER<br />An uncompromising manifestation of ferocity and
            utter discontent is probably the best way to describe the dismally
            melancholic sound of Teethgrinder. Hailing from the Netherlands,
            these grinders strive for an authentic yet progressive sound,
            spawned by a fusion of several genres, namely; grindcore, black
            metal, crust and sludge. Teethgrinder honours their roots and
            simultaneously attempts to broaden the spectrum of grindcore itself,
            resulting in an unsettling maelstrom of grinding ferocity.

            THE LUCIFER PRICIPLE<br />This grooving monstrous death metal
            machine brings something new to the table, The Lucifer Principle
            delivers old school death metal with a new school sound. The ultra
            heavy grooves are underlined by a pumping bass and stomping guitar
            riffs.

            DEATHMARCH<br />Formed in 2016 by Quint (guitar,
            ex-Bloodphemy/ex-Bodyfarm) and Olle (drums, ex-Funeral
            Whore/Cavitation), DEATHMARCH set out to deliver crude and crushing
            old school deathmetal<br />(think: Entombed, Dismember, Autopsy,
            Coffins).
