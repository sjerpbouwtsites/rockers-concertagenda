				<p>We are thrilled to announce that FrenchKickz will return to the East Side of the Netherlands, Arnhem. On Saturday, the 22th of February, we hope you will join our next huge collaboration with Outcast, delivering you a underground and hard experience in Willemeen, Arnhem (NL).</p><p>We heard you regarding previous events: Willemeen is an easy to reach location on a 2 minute walk from Arnhem Centraal and trains are running to Utrecht CS, Amsterdam CS and to other cities. It is also possible to reach Arnhem CS from Germany, operated by ICE International. Hotels are also in and around the station. For the ones coming by car, the location has plenty of spaces in the near garage of Arnhem Centraal. This is a paid garage. The sound system is upgraded and we will now host the main area of Willemeen.</p><p>We will share more information very soon, but we promise you that this will be a unique event, including the FrenchKickz family feeling that is known by all our fans who visited our events, from our lovely Netherlands; but also from lots of countries in whole Europe. Frenchkickz is for everyone and is here once again to gather all people who have the same love and passion for hard kicks, melodies and being up and close personal with artists and visitors . If you love not following the mainstream, and just want to be suprised instead of a predictable hardcore event. We dare you to join us together on this special night in February, 2025.</p>
