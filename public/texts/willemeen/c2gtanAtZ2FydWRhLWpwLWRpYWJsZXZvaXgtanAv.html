			<p>**IKIGAI Vol 2: Underground Idol live performance from Tokyo with: **</p><p><strong>SATANIC PUNISH</strong><br>A metalcore/deathcore Idol concept created in Tokyo, around June 2019. The sound of Satanic Punish…Brutal metal with an aerial grace of the Idol spirit behind it; Metalcore with a mostly genre-less structure, that even includes things like Chip Tunes and Rock. Songs about the absurdity, the inequality and the loss of sensibility of the society that surrounds us. A fighting spirit that executes punishment on things that are not judged by the law. Satanic Punish is doing something different in today’s Idol scene. Current member: Mana Manomu.</p><p>**GARUDA **<br>GARUDA is the dark industrial gothic solo project of Idol Yuffie Sakimura, who is simultaneously an active member of the Japanese alt-Idol group MELON BATAKE A GO GO, which performs rockabilly and psychobilly music, with as a theme, Superhero Sidekick. With GARUDA, she is taking alternative heavy Idol to the next level, both musically and visually. Since the release of her first single “Mousuguyukiga”, she has been captivating audiences across Japan and overseas. With her trademark bat, her plaque mask and especially her dark angel wings, GARUDA’s live performance is truly one of the most unique presentations in Japanese Idol.</p><p>**DIABLEVOIX **<br>Haluka. A soloist in the project DIABLEVOIX, Haluka sometimes appears with a live band. Active since 2017, she first appeared as a member of Lolisyn and after that as a member of Psycho Predator. Her past experiences, led her to this day, where performing as DIABLEVOIX, she is an undisputable Queen of the Obscure. Often tagged as Visual-Kei and J-Metal, she brings a mysterious and fulfilling presence on stage amidst a whirlwind of influences, ranging from Gothic to J-Rock, while visiting Extreme-Metal. From the very moment she sets foot on stage, one is instantly captivated and captured by her sheer appearance and swept off the mosh pit by the enticing music. Her vocals oscillate between fierce power and melodic softness, with the occasional growling, provided you worship her during her performance…which is impossible not to do! A unique, raw, underground solo Idol!</p><p><strong>Presented by The Chocolate Brothers</strong></p>			</div>
