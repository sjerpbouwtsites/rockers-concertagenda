			<p>**Tankard ** Special 100 minute set!!<br>After 40 steamrolling, liver wrecking, gut stretching years in the name of heavy metal, the Tankard beer train isn’t slowing down. Right in time for the festivities surrounding their 40th birthday, our most favourite Frankfurters let “Pawlow’s Dawgs” off the leash, their 18th overall record and debut for new label amigos Reaper Entertainment. Produced and recorded at Gernhard Studio Troisdorf again together with Martin Buchwalter. The taps are polished, the Freibier is flowing and Tankard are finally back to what they do best five long years after their last studio album: Thrashing madly, drinking thirstily and ever so cleverly intertwining metal, humour and sarcastic social commentary into one big raucous ball of entertainment. Just like they did all these years ago in a classroom where they drank beer out of emptied milk cartons. All hail Tankard. All hail the dawgs. The world is a better place with capital guys like them waiting at the bar.</p><p><strong>Obnoxious</strong><br>Local heroes Obnoxious are the perfect support for Tankard.!<br>Thrash band hailing from Arnhem characterized by their energetic riffs, crushing grooves and melodic solo's. Since their formation in 2020 the quartet has drawn inspiration from all over the scene from modern metal to classic rock.</p>			</div>
