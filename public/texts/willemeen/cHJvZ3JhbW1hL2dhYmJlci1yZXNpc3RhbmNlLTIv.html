			<p>GABBER RESISTANCE RETURNS TO WILLEMEEN!!!</p><p>Prepare yourself for what we think is our wildest, most intense lineup in Arnhem yet! This time, we’re taking it up a bit, delivering an unforgettable, more personal experience with some of your favourite DJs!</p><p>The one and only, the legend (Scott), is making his long-awaited return to vinyl in the Netherlands after more than 20 years! The mastermind behind the infamous Evolution Records, the man who gave birth to iconic sublabels like Twisted Vinyl and Screwdriver Records, Scott Brown has shaped the very foundation of hardcore music. His relentless productions have become a blueprint for gabber worldwide. Now, for the FIRST TIME EVER, he’ll be tearing up the decks at Gabber Resistance in the Netherlands!!!</p><p>But we’re not stopping there. Joining him is none other than the Italian vinyl butcher, (tizi). You know the drill: when this guy steps up, there’s no escape. No mercy. Expect nothing but brutality as he destroys the dancefloor with a savage, vinyl set. After countless requests, he’s finally here to unleash madness at Gabber Resistance on Dutch soil.</p><p>As always, recording or taking pictures is NOT allowed. Back in the 90s, mobile phones with cameras didn't exist. People were more connected with the music at parties. That is why at Gabber Resistance, we would like to recreate that vibe. We kindly ask everyone to obey this rule in order to contribute to the unique '90s vibe. STOP FILMING, START DANCING! (This includes any form of photography/videography)</p>			</div>
