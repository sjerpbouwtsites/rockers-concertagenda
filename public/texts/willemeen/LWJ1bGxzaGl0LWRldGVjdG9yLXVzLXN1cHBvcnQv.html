			<p><strong>We have some great news! LIBERTY &amp; JUSTICE + BULLSHIT DETECTOR from Texas will be coming to Arnhem!</strong><br>FFO: Chubby and the Gang, The Chisel, Conservative Military Image</p><p>**LIBERTY &amp; JUSTICE **<br>Liberty &amp; Justice were formed in 2015 and their first full lenght album "Pressure" (Contra Records) hit the scene lika a bomb in 2021. Since then they've released several EPs and Splits. While taking traditional cues from the likes of The Templars and 4Skins, L&amp;J arenâ€™t content to make by-the-numbers Oi. Instead giving nods to the channeled HC ferocity of Sheer Terror, the sing-along sincerity of The Trouble, the hard-scrabble outsider rock sensibilities of The Bruisers, and fight-ready mentality of Houston originalists Tread. Blending it all seamlessly into something authentically their own, L&amp;J unapologetically force their own voice through to the fore and out on to the streets.</p><p><strong>BULLSHIT DETECTOR</strong><br>Hard as nails Texas Oi with some great anarcho/wave style aesthetic. They've releasd a full lenght and several EPs via Contra Records in Europe. It will be their first time over here and there's a lot of people waiting for it!</p><p>NL/ local support tba.</p>			</div>
