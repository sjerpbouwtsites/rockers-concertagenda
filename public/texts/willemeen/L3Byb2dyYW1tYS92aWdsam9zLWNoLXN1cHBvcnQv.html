            <strong>Vígljós</strong><br />Ancient beekeeping black metal. An
            eerie buzz is growing louder from the Swiss city of Basel.
            Historically known for its century-long commitment to humanism and
            for being a safe haven to notable people such as Nietzsche, Jung,
            and Hesse, Basel is now the place where the black metal band Vígljós
            has established its hive.<br />In the case of Vigjlós, it all
            started with “The Beekeepers and the Birdnester”, a painting made by
            Pieter Bruegel the Elder in 1568 and featured in one of the 40
            museums found in Basel. According to the band, it had “everything
            that we felt was contained within our music: the horror, the craze,
            mystery, and beauty of his work was a perfect match.
