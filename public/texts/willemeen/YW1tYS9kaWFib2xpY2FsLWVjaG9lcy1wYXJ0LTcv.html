				<p><strong>Nyrak (BE)</strong><br>Nyrak is a progressive black metal band hailing from Belgium, embodying a relentless drive to push the boundaries of the genre. The band was conceived in 2021 by Guy Van Nieuwenhove, known in the metal community as Nevel of Gotmoor , as a bold and innovative solo studio project. His vision was to create a unique sound that combined the raw intensity of black metal with progressive elements, resulting in a sonic experience that is both dark and complex.</p><p><strong>Grafjammer</strong><br>Grafjammer hails from the medieval city of Utrecht and plays primitive Dutch necrorock. Think 1st and 2nd wave black metal with a hearty pinch of D-beat and Mötorhead in songs filled with folkloric murder and madness from the underbelly of society. All swinging like a floppy tit and kicking like a hobnailed boot under a fat ass. Be warned. Early 2025 will Grafjammer bring you their fourth full length album “De Tyfus, De Teerling” via Zwaertgevegt and Folter Records</p><p><strong>Asgrauw</strong><br>Established in 2010, Asgrauw has become a name synonymous with authenticity within the genre. Known for their atmospheric and second-wave black metal sound, Asgrauw adds a unique twist to their music, creating a fast-paced yet hostile ambiance that has captivated fans for over a decade.<br>Asgrauw has arrived at its sixth full-length album, musically a successor to Façade but with a new theme. This time Asgrauw has delved into the past, not contemporary history but that of ancient civilizations and what may have happened before on this earth. They released Oorsprong late 2024 via Zwaertgevegt and Hidden Marly Production.</p><p><strong>Veenlijk</strong><br>Veenlijk, established in 2023, is a Dutch black metal band hailing from the heart of the Netherlands. Drawing inspiration from the rich tapestry of local sagas, myths, and legends, Veenlijk’s music creates dark, atmospheric soundscapes that immerse listeners in the eerie and mystical realms of Dutch folklore.
