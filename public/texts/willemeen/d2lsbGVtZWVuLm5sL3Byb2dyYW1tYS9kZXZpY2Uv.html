			<p><strong>Device is a collective consisting of DJs, audiovisual artists and designers.</strong></p><p>After experimenting with virtual events, audiovisual installations and several one-off hostings and events, we are now diving head first into club nights.</p><p>We will go beyond house and techno, and land in the realm of forward thinking club music. To aid us in that quest we have invited a true sonic pioneer: French II. Drawing from a wide range of influences, his functional and murky, breaks- and percussion-heavy sound especially depicts French II's deep-rooted ties to UK bass music.</p><p>French II is supported by Device residents Phinny, Five Suns, T9 and Veld.</p><p>You've seen Device before in collaborations with local events like Forms and Sauce.</p>			</div>
