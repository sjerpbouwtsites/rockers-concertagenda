<p>Rosa Westerbaan is an artist who combines the smallest details with the biggest feelings. She takes you into her space and invites you to dance with our inner tide. You can expect thoughtful lyrics, wondering melodies an a warm sound. Think ‘Aurora meets Dutch indie pop’. Sometimes the songs are played with a band of 7, but for this event the songs will get a more intimate touch. She will perform them together with guitarist Fernando Rosas.</p>
<p>Salamander makes music like no other. They tell stories and spark wonder with their sharp-witted lyrics – sometimes critical, other times not at all.
