        <p><strong>Neon Noir: Alternatieve Choreo Chaos</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Ook in april is er weer een gloednieuwe editie van het queerste
            dansfeestje bij db’s.
        </p>
        <p>
            Op <strong>19 april</strong> gaan we weer helemaal los. Tussen
            <strong>00.00 en 04.00</strong> is db’s weer aan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Omdat discolampen, visuals, een rookmachine en een aantal uiterst
            getalenteerde DJ’s een winnende combinatie blijkt te zijn gaan we
            dat deze keer ook zeker weer brengen.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gewoon keiharde muziek, ruige vibes en een club vol mensen die klaar
            is om te feesten.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kom maar door met die chaotische choreografie en als je daar zin in
            hebt een hele lekkere outfit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Zin in georganiseerde choreo en een joggingbroek? Mag natuurlijk
            ook.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dit feestje is voor iedereen die zich thuisvoelt op een queer
            feestje.
        </p>
        <p>De bar is open, de muziek staat aan.</p>
        <p>Verlies jezelf zorgeloos in de nacht.</p>

            aria-label="Vertaalde tekst: Neon Noir: Alternative Choreo Chaos A brand new edition of the queerest dance party at db's is also coming up in April. On April 19, we're going all out again. db's will be on again between 23:00 and 03:00. Because disco lights, visuals, a smoke machine and a number of extremely talented DJs have proven to be a winning combination, we're definitely going to bring that again this time.&nbsp; Just loud music, rough vibes and a club full of people who are ready to party. Bring on that chaotic choreography and, if you feel like it, a really nice outfit. Fancy some organized choreography and sweatpants? Of course you can too. This party is for everyone who feels at home at a queer party. The bar is open, the music is on. Lose yourself carefree in the night. Date: 19/04/25 Time: 23:00 – 03:00 Get that ticket! Online: €4,- At the door: €5,- https://dbstudio.stager.co/web/tickets/111509236"
