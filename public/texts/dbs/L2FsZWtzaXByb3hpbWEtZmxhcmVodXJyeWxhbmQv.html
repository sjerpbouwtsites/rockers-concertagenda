<p>ALEKSI</p>
<p>Aleksi creates inspiring unifying performances, blending the drive of indie rock with the culture of singers-songwriters. He performs songs in various languages, including English, Russian and Georgian, reflecting on his status as a perpetual “outsider” in search of identity. His music is an atmospheric and hypnotic journey for those who have lost their homeland and fear rejection.</p>
<p>In his project Oorzicht (earsight)&nbsp; Aleksi Integrates video art from anti-war artists and interviews, conveying&nbsp; a never ending actuality of restating the humanitarian values. His work is a call to remember that we all seek connection and understanding in anti-militarisation, regardless of our backgrounds. Aleksis’ “Oorzicht” is also his graduation concert from the conservatory of Utrecht.</p>

Their second EP reached over 10,000 streams in the first three months! Over the years, they’ve played plenty of shows across the Netherlands, including opening for Ibuiltthesky, and they’ve also taken their music abroad with a show in Germany.</p>


<p>HURRYLAND</p>
<p>Get ready to get your mind twisted and feelings modulated with the jazz influenced progressive metal band Hurryland!
