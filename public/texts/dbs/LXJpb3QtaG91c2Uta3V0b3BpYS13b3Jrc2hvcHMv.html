            The Riot House offers a series of workshops with the goal to bring
            diversity and inclusivity in DIY music within a safer and supportive
            environment for people new to playing music.
        </p>
        <p>
            We highly support and encourage women, persons of colour, lgbtqia+,
            neurodiverse, disabled persons to join.

            People of any musical experience can attend our workshops, though
            they are largely aimed at beginners. You will learn to play an
            instrument (guitar, bass, drums, keyboards, or vocals), form a band,
            write a song, and perform your song at the end of the day as the
            opening act for the festival.
        </p>
        <p>
            You do not have to bring your own instrument, although you are
            welcome to do so. We will provide instruments and equipment during
            the workshop. In your registration, you will be asked to pick two
            different instruments you would be interested in playing in your
            band. The choices are bass, drums, guitar, keyboards, or vocals.
        </p>

            Our coaches will help you to explore musical improvisation and
            creative freedom in a punk, DIY and empowering way and guide you
            through the process to ultimately play your song on stage at the end
            of the day.
        </p>

            Cost to attend our workshop is free but you are welcome to donate a
            pay what you want fee to support our organisation and coaches.
