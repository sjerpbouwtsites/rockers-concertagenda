        <div>
            || BRAK (DE)<br />
            A noisy trio exploring sonic dissonances and cross-genre
            intricacies, navigating between no wave, noise and punk. Expert
            at<span class="gmail_default">&nbsp;</span>dashing out cascades of
            sound accelerating, rotting and falling apart. In a cultural and
            social climate reliant on rules and adherence to standards of
            practice, BRAK stands totemic and atomic.

            || LOUSE (BE)<br />
            Purveyors of the finest cellar-dweller scum rock. A carnival in an
            open sewer. Whatever septic fluid got in the water in Sweden managed
            to find its way to the grim English north. The perfect amalgamation
            of their other projects; Foot Hair and The Shits. Do the wrong
            thing, and answer the call.

            || TZU NI (TW)<br />
            Momentary isolation from the outer world, intense perception of
            one’s frame of mind &amp; body. A sound artist from Taiwan who
            recently shifted to the Netherlands. Her work primarily focuses on
            spatial and sonic installations, field recordings, the acoustics of
            objects, and computer-generated noise.
