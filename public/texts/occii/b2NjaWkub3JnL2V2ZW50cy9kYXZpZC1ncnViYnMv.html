<h3>Ex-<strong>Squirrel Bait</strong>, <strong>Gastr Del Sol</strong> guitarist offers meticulously crafted record with a weirdness lurking underneath</h3>
<p>Over the course of his forty-plus years career in music, <strong>David Grubbs</strong> stands out as sort of an unlikely journeyman. His work spans the sweaty post-hardcore of early band <strong>Squirrel Bait</strong>, the radical experiments of his highly influential group <strong>Gastr Del Sol</strong>, and the deconstructed singer-songwriter music of his early solo work. Yet, his forward-thinking approach seems less rooted in ambition or polymathic desire, and is more a condition of a genuine sense of curiosity that often manifests in very subtly oft-kilter music. <strong>Grubbs</strong>’ most recent release, <em>Whistle From Above</em>, is a testament to this dynamic, a contemplative work that finds abstraction in tranquillity, and vice versa.</p>
<p><em>Whistle</em> is <strong>Grubbs</strong>’ first solo album since 2017’s <em>Creep Mission</em>, and over the course of the past eight years much of <strong>Grubbs</strong>’ work has focused on collaborations with fellow travellers in genre-defying experimentalism such as <strong>Taku Unami</strong>, <strong>Loren Connors</strong> and <strong>Alan Courtis</strong>, as well as writing three books. Last year, after reconnecting with former bandmate <strong>Jim O’Rourke</strong>, the two released a collection of unheard <strong>Gastr Del Sol</strong> recordings, <em>We Have Dozens of Titles</em>. This was a pleasant surprise from two musicians who have not made much time for looking back, but the experience seems to have been invigorating for both of them. One can hear that sense of introspection factoring into<em> Whistle From Above</em>, which calls back to <strong>Grubbs</strong>’ previous work while still standing alone as a work in and of itself.</p>

<h3>Red Brut :: Spontaneous sound collage</h3>
<p>The artistic alias of Dutch artist <strong>Marijn Verbiesen</strong> (aka <strong>Red Brut</strong>), who recently moved to Groningen and has been a vital force in Rotterdam’s art scene. Her work reveals a particular sensitivity to everyday sounds, the soundscapes of cassette music, musique concrète, and spontaneous sound collage, combining these elements into a unique and truly personal avant-garde expression.</p>


<p><strong>Red Brut</strong>’s third album, <em>On Bare Ground</em>, is a sonic tapestry woven from the final threads of her Rotterdam existence. Entirely composed of soundscapes captured during her last two years in the city, the album evolves into a poignant farewell as its creation mirrors the passage of time, culminating in a profound departure from her life there.</p>
<p><em>On Bare Ground</em> is a sculptural work blending its lo-fi with haunting melodies, field recordings, and ethereal soundscapes. Uncompromising in its approach, the album evokes the echoes of experimental music from a spectrum that ranges from dark bedroom pop to rhythmic noise, crafting a cloudy and dreamlike atmosphere. With meticulous attention, it unfolds as a strong hypnotic journey, where intricate sounds emerge from a hidden center, while, in a parallel narrative, they gradually expose <em>On Bare Ground</em>’s underlying deep melancholic core.</p>
