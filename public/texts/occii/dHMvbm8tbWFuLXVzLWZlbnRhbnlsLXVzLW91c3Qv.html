<p>NØ MAN – US
Washington D.C.’s NØ MAN is a necessary and much-needed voice in modern hardcore. Formed in 2017, the four-piece punk band has been alchemising the personal and the political from the jump. Composed of members from Majority Rule, the band’s current aims go hand-in-hand with their past, sonically and thematically.
As the daughter of refugees, returning home to Palestine included witnessing first-hand the casual atrocities inflicted on her family. Though written before the current conflict’s boiling point, <em>Glitter and Spit</em> synthesises the 70+ years of systemic violence carried out against Palestine and her own lived experiences. From school teachers and classmates telling her Palestine doesn’t exist, to being humiliated by soldiers at checkpoints when she visited her family, these many moments fuel the album’s <em>Lifeblood</em>, coalescing on <em>“Can’t Kill Us All.”</em></p>
<p>OUST
With the rhythm of frenetic drums that shift between speed and mid-tempo, impossible guitar riffs, and inherent bass lines forming the solid foundation of a voice full of hate and many things to say, OUST delivers contemporary hardcore in its purest form.</p>
<p>FENTANYL – US
Razor sharp guitars, forging treble into a blade through your ear drum. Raw, unbridled hardcore punk the way it was meant to be from the Bay’s usual suspects. There’s a members of list but you probably already know it. Destruction, distress, chaos. This one’s a racket.</p>
