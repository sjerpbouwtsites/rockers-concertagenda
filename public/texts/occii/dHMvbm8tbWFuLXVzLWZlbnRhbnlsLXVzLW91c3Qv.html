            <strong>NØ MAN</strong> – US<br />
            Washington D.C.’s <strong>NØ MAN</strong> is a necessary and
            much-needed voice in modern hardcore. Formed in 2017, the four-piece
            punk band has been alchemising the personal and the political from
            the jump. Composed of members from <strong>Majority Rule</strong>,
            the band’s current aims go hand-in-hand with their past, sonically
            and thematically.<br />
            As the daughter of refugees, returning home to
            <strong>Palestine</strong> included witnessing first-hand the casual
            atrocities inflicted on her family. Though written before the
            current conflict’s boiling point,
            <em>Glitter and Spit</em> synthesises the 70+ years of systemic
            violence carried out against <strong>Palestine</strong> and her own
            lived experiences. From school teachers and classmates telling her
            <strong>Palestine</strong> doesn’t exist, to being humiliated by
            soldiers at checkpoints when she visited her family, these many
            moments fuel the album’s <em>Lifeblood</em>, coalescing on
            <strong><em>“Can’t Kill Us All.”</em></strong>

            <strong>OUST</strong><br />
            With the rhythm of frenetic drums that shift between speed and
            mid-tempo, impossible guitar riffs, and inherent bass lines forming
            the solid foundation of a voice full of hate and many things to say,
            <strong>OUST</strong> delivers contemporary hardcore in its purest
            form.

            <strong>FENTANYL</strong> – US<br />
            Razor sharp guitars, forging treble into a blade through your ear
            drum. Raw, unbridled hardcore punk the way it was meant to be from
            the Bay’s usual suspects. There’s a members of list but you probably
            already know it. Destruction, distress, chaos. This one’s a racket.
