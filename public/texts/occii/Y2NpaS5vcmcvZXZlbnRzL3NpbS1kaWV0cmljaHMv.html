<p><strong>Dietrichs: Don Dietrich &amp; Camille Dietrich</strong> (US)<br>
Legendary saxophonist<strong> Don Dietrich</strong> and his cellist daughter <strong>Camille Dietrich</strong> come together in <strong>Dietrichs</strong>, a pairing music critic <strong>Byron Coley</strong> calls <em>“sheer wailing sonic pleasure.”</em> <strong>Don</strong> has been a driving force as a member of <a href="https://www.borbetomagus.com/"><strong>Borbetomagus</strong> </a>for over four decades, known for his volatile style and <em>“unyielding wall of sound.”</em> <a href="https://www.camilledietrich.com/"><strong>Camille</strong></a>’s raw energy balances classically trained precision with the instinctive flair of someone raised on aggressive improvisation. Together, they drown audiences in sound, leaving an impact long after their final note fades.</p>
<p><strong>Dietrichs</strong> began their journey in 2017 with their debut  on <strong>Pica Disk Records</strong>, followed by a series of performances that landed them a spot on the list of <strong>Jazz Right Now</strong>‘s Best Live Concerts of 2018. In 2021, the duo joined <strong>Feeding Tube Records</strong>‘&nbsp;Quarantunes Series, subsequently releasing the recording with the same label. Their livestream was ranked in <strong>Art Forum Magazine</strong>’s “<strong>Alan Licht</strong>’s Best Music of 2021.” <strong>Dietrichs</strong> released the critically acclaimed third album<em> “Catch the Leaves”</em> through <strong>Relative Pitch Records</strong> in 2023, followed by its 2024  via <strong>Feeding Tube Records.</strong> A new <strong>Dietrichs</strong> studio recording <em>‘No Badhu’</em> will be released by <strong>Relative Pitch</strong> to coincide with this first European tour.</p>
<p><strong>Jef Mertens</strong> (BE)<br>

<p><strong>Bhajan Bhoy</strong> (UK/NL)<br>

New Album 14-02-2025: <em>“Bhoy On The Wire”</em> – <strong>Cardinal Fuzz</strong> (UK) / <strong>Feeding Tube Records</strong> (USA)</p>
<p><strong>Ajay Saggar</strong> is <strong>BHAJAN BHOY</strong>.<br>
“With <strong>BHAJAN BHOY</strong>, <strong>Saggar</strong> synthesizes all of the stylistic approaches he’s explored over the years, swirling them into an intoxicating musical blend, with an earthy spirituality. Even the project’s name reflects the dual aspects of <strong>Saggar</strong>‘s upbringing coming together in harmony. In Hindi, a <em>“bhajan”</em> is a devotional song, sung in the mandir, or temple, while <em>“bhoy”</em> is a Scottish and Irish derivation for a young man. There’s a searching quality to <strong>Bhajan Bhoy</strong>, as if <strong>Saggar</strong> is still hunting for transcendence with each track, whether through an expansive drone, an orchestral facility on the piano, or an electronics-augmented raga that threatens to dip into noise” (<strong>Erick Bradshaw</strong> / writer and <strong>WFMU</strong> DJ).</p>
<p>This album presents a rich and varied set of compositions that showcase <strong>Saggar</strong>‘s skills as an incredibly talented and accomplished composer and musician. With each and every  LP, you are carried to a higher place. With <em>‘Bhoy On The Wire’</em>, the 35 minutes laid out unfolds like a cosmic tapestry, an extraordinary exploration that shimmers and reverberates with newfound vibrancy. The songs were broadcast as part of a session on <strong>Steve Barker’s <em>“On The Wire”</em></strong> radio show in April 2024. They were a gift to Steve and his team for 40 years of broadcasting. <em>“On The Wire”</em> is simply the greatest radio show in the world.</p>
