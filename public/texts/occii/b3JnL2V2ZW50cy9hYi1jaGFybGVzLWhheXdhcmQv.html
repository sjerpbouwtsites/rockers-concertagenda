<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong> <strong>CONCRETE </strong>(UK/EU)</p>
<p><strong>Charles Hayward</strong>: Drums &amp; Voice<br>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT CONCRETE</strong> is another big step for UK underground heavyweight <strong>Charles Hayward</strong> on his music journey (<strong>This Heat</strong>, <strong>Camberwell Now</strong>, <strong>Quiet Sun</strong>, <strong>Massacre</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT CONCRETE</strong> is music which spans a wide emotional landscape focussed on connection and communication using a genre fluid sound world of song, groove and fire with all the lyrical intensity the world demands right now.<br>
<strong>ABSTRACT CONCRETE</strong> brings together some of the most exciting and forward-thinking young London players from a diversity of European underground and experimental scenes.</p>
<p>Combining sweet chamber pop hooks with dubwise bass, plaintive Balearic guitar licks, and a blend of folk and jazz-informed post punk, accompanied by lyrics that bend from the political to depressed toilet cleaning apparatus, <strong>Abstract Concrete</strong> follows a continuum of such melodic art school innovators as <strong>The Kinks</strong>, <strong>Brian Eno</strong>, <strong>Robert Wyatt</strong> and <strong>Penguin Cafe Orchestra</strong>, as well as <strong>Hayward</strong>’s own experimental post punk past, all the while nodding to a childhood spent listening to folk and pop.<br>
Their <em>self-titled</em> debut album is due for release on 17 November on vinyl, CD and digital, as well as a special <strong>state51</strong> Atelier Edition of 51</p>

He curates a six monthly series of performances, workshops and installation called <strong>Charles Hayward Presents</strong> on behalf of Lewisham Arthouse for Albany Theatre. Recent releases include <em>‘Objects of Desire’</em> cassette on <strong>Blank Editions</strong> and the piano centred song cycle <em>‘Begin Anywhere’</em> on <strong>Klanggalerie</strong> &amp; <strong>God Unknown Records</strong>.</p>
