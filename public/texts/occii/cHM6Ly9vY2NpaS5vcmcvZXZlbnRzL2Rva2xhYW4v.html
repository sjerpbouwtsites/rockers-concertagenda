            <strong>MORE EAZE</strong> is the project of brooklyn-based sound
            artist and multi-instrumentalist<strong> Mari Maurice Rubio</strong
            >. Ranging from ambient pop to folk and musique concrete, her
            numerous solo and collaborative releases weave mundane, everyday
            sounds, acoustic orchestration and instrumentation, and electronics
            into adventurous textural compositions. Her music explores themes of
            intimacy, yearning, Americana, and the transformation of abstract
            feeling into intense living through compositions that moves
            seamlessly between the banal and the ethereal. She has recently
            released work with <strong>Longform Editions</strong>,
            <strong>Leaving Records</strong>, <strong>Ecstatic</strong>, and
            <strong>Orange Milk</strong> with forthcoming releases on<strong>
                Thrill Jockey</strong
            >
            and <strong>15 love</strong>. Her work as a string arranger, pedal
            steel player, and producer has recently been featured on recordings
            by <strong>Martha Skye Murphy</strong>,
            <strong>Water Damage</strong>, <strong>Lomelda</strong>,
            <strong>Fashion Club</strong>, <strong>Claire Rousay</strong>,
            <strong>Space Afrika</strong> <strong>and Rainy Miller</strong>, and

            <strong>Wendy Eisenberg</strong>). Since fall of 2024,

            <strong>Wendy Eisenberg</strong> is an improviser and songwriter who
            plays guitar, tenor banjo, synthesiser, bass and voice. Their work
            tries to demystify and then immediately, subconsciously re-mystify
            what a guitar can do within and around songs, and as such is about
            memory, perception, and love. In addition to their genre-agnostic
            solo work, they are a member of the
            <strong>Bill Orcutt Guitar Quartet</strong>,
            <strong>Editrix</strong>, <strong>Squanderers</strong> (with
            <strong>Kramer</strong> and <strong>David Grubbs</strong>),
            <strong>Darlin</strong> (with <strong>Ryan Sawyer</strong> and
            <strong>Lester St Louis</strong>), and work closely with
            <strong>Caroline Davis</strong>, <strong>John Zorn</strong>, and
            <strong>more eaze</strong>. They are an Assistant Professor of
            songwriting, music theory, guitar, and other such overlaps at
            <strong>The New School</strong>, and have published essays about
            music and other things in <strong>Sound American</strong>,
            <strong>Arcana</strong>, and the
            <strong>Contemporary Music Review</strong>.

            <strong>BHAJAN BHOY</strong> : Deep meditative music filled with
            kosmische guitar psych magic / sonic raga trips / melodic mantras /
            esoteric electronica that thrill and elevate the listener to a
            higher sonic plane. Several LP releases and tours of the USA, UK,
            and Europe, and appearances at
            <strong>Le Guess Who? festival</strong> have cemented
            <strong>Bhajan Bhoyâ€™s</strong> reputation as one of the best guitar
            + electronic performers at present.
