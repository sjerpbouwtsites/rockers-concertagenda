<p>PUFFER
Montreal’s PUFFER lands in Amsterdam with a slab of lumpen punk’n’roll which offers a little more nuance and intrigue than your usual troglodyte Oi!-tinged hardcore. Vocals are reminiscent of NO TIME, and sound not too dissimilar to what I’d imagine it’d be like if a rottweiler learned to sing. Interestingly, there’s a bit of groove here with the tambourine flourishes and guitar solos, a bit like if MC5 cut their hair and had a wash.</p>
<p>BÉTON ARMÉ
Béton Armé is a montreal oi! band inspired by french punk/oi! bands from the 80’s. They are the real deal. It seems a little reductive making the comparison merely owing to their shared Francophile nature, but this really does feel like a spiritual cousin to a RIXE EP—earworm choruses, buzzsaw guitars, and gang vox designed to be yelled while covered in lager. Extremely worth it!</p>
<p>FRONTSECTOR
FRONTSECTOR, one of Groningen’s best and most exiting punk bands. The four give us punk as it was once meant to be played: against the status quo, against the system and without more chords than necessary.</p>
