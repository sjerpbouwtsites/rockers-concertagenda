            Geregeld Ontregeld presents: Die Verlierer &amp; Desintresse for a
            night of post-punk, coldwave &amp; eggpunk for fans of Pisse, Warsaw
            &amp; Molchat Doma<strong><br /> </strong>

            <strong>DIE VERLIERER</strong><br />
            Berlin-based bunker punks Die Verlierer resurface wielding another
            round of Earth-scorching recordings with their sophomore LP,
            Notausgang. After a game-changing debut LP, the band continues to
            craft tuneful yet wiry jams that are well-informed by prodding,
            proto-punk archetypes and our gloomy, motorik post-punk ancestors;
            think Warsaw, Crass, and The Stooges.

            The performances have a gritty live feeling: the sound of the
            recording is warm and organic, captured in analog tape glow. Die
            Verlierer are the real deal—’70s punk artifacts dropped into modern
            times.<br />

            <strong>DESINTRESSE<br /> </strong>Desinteresse is a Dutch coldwave
            band consisting of Bart (bass), Joppe (drums) and Sem
            (vocals/synth/guitar). The band comes from the southern province
            Limburg and was officially formed in November 2022. The band started
            out as a duo, but has been functioning as a three piece since 2024.
            Their latest release is the 7” single ‘Grijze Dromen’ (August 2024).
            All releases up until now have been released on their own label
            ‘DECADENCE’. Their aim is to recreate the sound from a past era,
            using only analog equipment, seeing this as a form of art, identity
            and expression.<br />
            Cold, abandoned and non-existential feelings mark the melancholic
            and gloomy atmosphere on stage. Still sounds and voices are not
            primary – though the message is.<br />
