<p><strong>The Flying Luttenbachers</strong>, pioneers of chaotic sound and uncompromising energy, are embarking on a European tour this April 2025! Known for their explosive blend of avant-jazz, noise rock, and relentless improvisation, this band has been pushing the boundaries of underground music for decades.</p>
<div>
<p>Formed in Chicago in 1991, moved to California in 2003, disbanded in 2007, reformed in New York in 2017,&nbsp;then relocated back to Chicago in 2022, <strong>The Flying Luttenbachers</strong> recently completed a crushing direct support slot on 8 dates of Japanese Noisesters <strong>Melt-Banana</strong> May/June 2024 headlining tour. The latest trio formation of the <strong>Luttenbachers</strong> is a tight, intense, wild beast executing complex compositions with visceral&nbsp;showmanship and presence. The music is hypercomposed <strong>BRUTAL PROG</strong> – not your grandpa’s<em> “prog rock”</em>, but an intricate, detailed assault fueled by <strong>punk, no wave, free jazz, </strong>and <strong>extreme metal</strong>. As documented on the&nbsp;recent live-in-studio, no bs EP <em>“Spectral Warrior Mythos 2”</em>, today’s band is on fire. The new proper <strong>Flying Luttenbachers</strong>’ full-length<em> “Losing The War Inside Our Heads”</em> is released on LP/CD/download in July 2024 and&nbsp;the band will be supporting the release with US touring this Winter and a European tour in early 2025.</p>
<p>Since erupting forth in 1991, the seminal punk jazz/brutal prog/no wave band <strong>The Flying Luttenbachers</strong> has steadily deconstructed music, reason, and all notions of sanity on 20 releases and more than 400 live performances around the world. Predictably unpredictable, the <strong>Luttenabachers</strong>’ fierce, modernistic approach draws&nbsp;from inspirations like <strong>No Wave, Free Jazz, Death Metal, Noise, Modern Classical, Free Improvisation, Punk&nbsp;and the blackest humor possible</strong>. (The universe has been destroyed a few times during the course of the cryptic plot running through the releases.) During the initial runs in Chicago and the Bay Area of California, some of&nbsp;the prominent musicians that came through the ranks included: <strong>Ed Rodriguez (Deerhoof), Mick Barr (Krallice), Hal Russell (NRG Ensemble), Jonathan Hischke (Dot Hacker), Alex Perkolup (Cheer-Accident),&nbsp;Fred Lonberg-Holm, Ken Vandermark</strong> and many others. After a ten year break, a now NYC-based <strong>Flying Luttenbachers</strong> emerged again in 2017 and made a week long tour of France, performing an hour long set of&nbsp;classic material from the entire catalog and culminating at the Sonic Protest festival in Paris.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new-era albums <em>“Shattered Dimension”</em> (harmolodic skronk), <em>“Imminent Death”</em> (an angular tribute to ‘70s <strong>Miles Davis</strong>),&nbsp;<em>“Negative Infinity”</em> (a brutal prog highwater mark), and <em>“Terror Iridescence”</em> (bizarre outerspace minimalism) continued the group’s diverse agenda of organizing dissonance and energy. Never tame or predictable, <strong>The Flying Luttenbachers</strong> continue to assault musical mediocrity. The latest incarnation of this iconoclastic unit heads in yet another bold new direction . . . After the four full-length albums and numerous shows and tours&nbsp;with the New York-based lineups of the band (featuring various combinations of<strong> Tim Dahl, Matt Nelson, Brandon Seabrook, Katie Battistoni, Alex Ward, Wendy Eisenberg, Henry Kaiser, Chris Welcome and Evan&nbsp;Lipson</strong>), erstwhile leader and founding member <strong>Weasel Walter</strong> decided to change up the scenery by heading&nbsp;back to the original ground zero – Chicago. The latest formation is a stripped down power trio featuring <strong>Mr. Walter </strong>on guitar<strong>, </strong>bassist <strong>Luke Polipnick, </strong>and drummer<strong> James Paul Nadien.</strong></p>
