                <strong>Al Schvitz</strong>,
                <strong>Mikey ‘Offender’ Donaldson</strong>, and
                <strong>“x-con Ron”</strong> <strong>Posner</strong> put out
                their first two-song single 7” as <strong>The Stains</strong>.
                Shortly afterwards, they were duly christened
                <strong>Millions of Dead Cops</strong> by
                <strong>Buxf Parrot</strong>, the hardcore bass player of
                <strong>The Dicks</strong>. And the rest, as they say, is

                ><strong>M.D.C.</strong> is a musical and political organization
                always striving to make intelligent, powerful, political
                statements that scream loudly against political insanity and
                social malignancy, addressing oppression and the human
                condition. Their originality challenges and often rivals, with
                their distinctly blunt and radical views, some of the most
                iconic bands of the past-and-present punk scene often littered
                with meaningless personal topical babble.</span

            <span style="font-family: Arial, serif"
                ><strong>M.D.C.</strong> undoubtedly influenced many bands of
                today, evident in many modern anti-government and
                anti-oppression oriented groups, as early American Punk folklore
                blazoned its course through the past 44 years.
                <strong>M.D.C.</strong> was on the cover of the FIRST issue of
                <strong>Maximum Rock’n’Roll</strong>, which also includes a band
                interview. They have had major articles in
                <strong>Playboy</strong>, <strong>Spin</strong>,
                <strong>Sounds</strong>, and interviews far too numerous to
                count in local papers and fanzines across the globe. As an
                integral part of early American Punk folklore, it is not
                surprising to find references to <strong>M.D.C.</strong> in the
                annals of punk history and beyond the boundaries of mainstream
                music culture–their honourable mention in the alternative duo
                <strong>They Might Be Giants’</strong> song
                <em>“Rhythm Section Want Ad”</em> and the
                <em>“Millions of Dead Cops”</em> album ranking #7 on
                <strong>Kurt Cobain</strong>’s all-time favourite list are two
                interesting examples.
