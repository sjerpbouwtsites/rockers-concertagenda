    <p><strong>HC/PUNK!<br>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>HELLSHOCK</strong><br>
All the way from Portland Oregon.<br>
Combining elements of crust and stench core.&nbsp; Members of <strong>From Ashes Rise</strong> and <strong>Remains of the Day</strong>.<br>
Very exciting that these legends in there genre are coming over to our beautiful stable house…<br>
<em>***only dutch show***</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<span><span> Neck aching tempos, sheer brutality, growled anguished vocals, and epic song writing without straying from pure unadulterated crust. .. For the newcomer, if they were to ask “what is this crust/stenchcore thing about?”, I would point them to <strong>AMEBIX</strong>, <strong>DEVIATED</strong> <strong>INSTINCT</strong>, <strong>AXEGRINDER</strong>, and <strong>HELLSHOCK</strong>. The name deserves to be right beside the creators and masters….<br>

<p><strong>SEEIN RED</strong><br>
short, fast &amp; loud.</p>
<p>Pure fast uncompromising DIY hardcore punk and anarcho communist socialist lyrics since ’88. No shut up and play, but a sincere voice fighting the system of capitalism. These NL. cult HC pioneers don’t live in the past but take it no holds barred to the present: a sonic power A-bomb!</p>
