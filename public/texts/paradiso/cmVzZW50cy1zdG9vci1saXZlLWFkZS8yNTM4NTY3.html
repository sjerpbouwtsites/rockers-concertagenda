    <p>During ADE 2025, Speedy J and the STOOR crew return to Paradiso for a two-day edition of audiovisual spectacle STOOR live. Pink Noise, the new platform for live electronic music, will once again host the Upstairs Room.<br></p>
<p>STOOR Live is a fully improvised hardware jam between alternating musicians, led by techno producer Speedy J. Stage design, lighting and a team of video artists are directed by spatial designer Karl Klomp. Using robotic cameras and video hardware hacks on an LED video object, image and sound merge into an 8-hour symbiosis of unbridled electronics.</p>
