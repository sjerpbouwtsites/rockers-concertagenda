					<p>DAYSEEKER + Rain City Drive + Heart of Gold</p>

<p>After a run as main support for Pierce The Veil with a stop at Ancienne Belgique, Dayseeker return to Belgium for a headline show at Kavka Zappa! Support by Rain City Drive and Heart of Gold.<br>
Tickets available on Wednesday 17th of April at 11:00.</p>
<p>DAYSEEKER embody what a rock band can be in the 21 st century. Untethered from rules and agnostic of genre confines, the Southern California quartet—Rory Rodriguez [vocals], Gino Sgambelluri [guitar], Ramone Valerio [bass], and Mike Karle [drums]—exist outside of any and all boundaries. As such, they seamlessly absorb culture at lightspeed, layering hypnotic hard rock and metallic catharsis above soundscapes punctuated by glistening post-pop, experimental indie, and alternative R&amp;B. Tallying hundreds of millions of streams, selling out shows, and earning acclaim from the likes of Alternative Press and more, the band crystallize this outlier vision on their 2022 fifth full-length offering, Dark Sun [Spinefarm Records].<br>
