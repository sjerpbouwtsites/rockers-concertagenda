					<p><span data-contrast="auto">Since their emergence in 2021, ten56. has cemented itself as a prominent force in modern metal. Fusing raw aggression, crushing production, and an outstanding stage presence, the band has continuously pushed past boundaries. After leaving a lasting impact with their acclaimed debut album Downer, ten56. is gearing up to release an even more devastating second record.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">With an unyielding work ethic, beating the road relentlessly supporting While She Sleeps, Landmvrks and Northlane, and unleashing their chaotic catharsis across seas to the USA, Japan and Australia, ten56 are finally set to headline their first EU/UK tour. Bringing with them both long-awaited VCTMS and The Dali Thundering Concept, plus a very special guest yet to be announced.</span><span data-ccp-props="{}">&nbsp;</span></p>
