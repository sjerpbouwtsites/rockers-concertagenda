     <p>BETTER LOVERS (us)
By challenging each other to progress, Better Lovers challenge heavy music to move forward along with them. Driven by the same restless spirit and clear intention, this cohort of longtime musicians have rallied around a shared vision of creative fearlessness and relentless energy. Playing with a chemistry bordering on magic, the musicians—Greg Puciato [vocals], Jordan Buckley [guitar], Will Putney [guitar, producer], Steve Micciche [bass], and Clayton “Goose” Holyoak [drums]—naturally evolve on their 2024 full-length debut album, Highly Irresponsible. New York band Better Lovers (ex-members of Every Time I Die, Dillinger Escape Plan) will perform ‘Highly Irresponsible’, which is their debut album. If you like pure chaotic hardcore and metalcore this album delivers in buckets!</p>

<p>‘68 (us)
an American rock duo that formed in 2013.
The two-piece band features guitarist and vocalist Josh Scogin, formerly of the hardcore band The Chariot, and drummer named Nikko Yamada.</p>

<p>Greyhaven (us)
The band has magnified the scope of heavy music since emerging in 2013. The group transfixed audiences with Empty Black [2018] and This Bright and Beautiful World [2022], gathering streams in the tens of millions. Beyond praise from Revolver, KERRANG!, and more, New Noise Magazine professed, “Greyhaven have proven themselves as a force to be reckoned with in the post-hardcore and the heavy music scene at large with their latest release,” and Blabbermouth applauded how “musicianship and eloquence are apparent.” Throughout 2023, they assembled what would become Stereo Grief with producer Will Putney. Expanding on the EP, which takes inspiration from the classic short story And He Built A Crooked House by Robert A. Heinlein, Mills states,”The EP is a loose story of someone navigating existential fear relating to all life and all death on a grand scale through a multi-dimensional lens. I was inspired by a short story I read while we were tracking that sort of serves as a backdrop for what’s going on in the lyrics. Overall, I feel like this is the best material we’ve written so far and it’s only hinting at where we’re going. We couldn’t be more excited to release it with a new team behind us.”</p>
