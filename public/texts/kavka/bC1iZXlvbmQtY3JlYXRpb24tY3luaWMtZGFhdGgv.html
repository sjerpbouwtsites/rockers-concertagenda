<p>Prepare for an epic journey through the realms of progressive death metal as <strong>Rivers of Nihil</strong> bring their mind-bending sound to Zappa, Antwerp on 1 March 2025! Known for their innovative fusion of crushing heaviness and atmospheric depth, Rivers of Nihil have redefined the boundaries of extreme metal, and this show promises to be nothing short of breathtaking.</p>
<p>As if that weren’t enough, they’ll be joined by a stellar lineup of genre-defying support. <strong>Cynic</strong>, the pioneers of progressive death metal, will deliver their legendary blend of technical mastery and spiritual exploration. <strong>Beyond Creation</strong>, the Canadian force of nature, will push the limits of musicianship with their intricate, otherworldly compositions.
