					<p><strong>CASKETS</strong><br>
Caskets have embraced growth and introspection with their second album, Reflections, a bold and collaborative step forward from their acclaimed debut, Lost Souls. While their first record introduced audiences to vocalist Matt Flood’s deeply personal storytelling, Reflections captures the collective voice of the band—Flood, guitarists Benji Wilson and Craig Robinson, bassist Chris McIntosh, and drummer James Lazenby. After years of touring, including landmark performances at Download and Slam Dunk, the band forged an even stronger connection, channeling their shared experiences into a cohesive and dynamic sound.<br>
Produced by Dan Weller (Holding Absence, Bury Tomorrow), Reflections combines sweeping melodies, ambient textures, and raw emotional power. Songs like “Guiding Light” explore resilience in the face of heartbreak, while “Silhouettes” celebrates self-worth and individuality. The orchestral closer “Better Way Out” provides a cathartic resolution, showcasing the band’s ability to tackle profound themes with grace. With a renewed sense of unity and creative vision, Reflections reaffirms Caskets’ place as a band unafraid to evolve while staying true to the heart of their music.</p>
<p><strong>Colorblind</strong><br>
Dreamcore band from Austin, TX. With lyrical depth matched only by their ascendant vocals, Austin, TX, dreamcore staples COLORBLIND have quickly become a name to know in the heavy music world, racking up some 28 million Spotify streams thanks to their rumbling rhythm section, ​​earth-shaking riffs and airy grooves. That hard-hitting musical combination forms the backbone of “NEEDLE EYE,” Colorblind’s debut single for Solid State/Tooth &amp; Nail. Building on the success of the 2021 hit “Motionless” and self-titled 2022 EP, “Needle Eye” announces a new era for the band – vocalist Travis Moseley, drummer Tyler Moseley, bassist Nicholas Asper and guitarist Justin Page – with a triumphant widescreen sound, car crash dynamics and visceral, open-nerve lyricism.</p>
