            Castle Rat is a fantasy doom metal band hailing from NYC led by The
            Rat Queen on guitar and vocals. On her mission to expand and defend
            “The Realm” from those who seek to destroy it, The Rat Queen is
            joined by The Count on lead guitar, The Plague Doctor on bass, and

            wrath of their arch nemesis: Death, Herself — The Rat Reaperess. The
            Realm of Castle Rat exists for those who crave swords &amp; sorcery;
            stoner &amp; doom; Frazetta &amp; Sabbath; battle-babes &amp;
            beasts.
