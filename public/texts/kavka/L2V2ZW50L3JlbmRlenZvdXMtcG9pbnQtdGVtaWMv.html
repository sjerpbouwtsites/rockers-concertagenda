					<p>The musicians in <strong>Rendezvous Point</strong> met when they studied rhythmical music at the University of Agder. In 2012 the band was titled the most promising band in southern Norway and held a concert with the Kristiansand Symphony Orchestra.<br>
They have spend their early years touring Europe with bands like Haken, Leprous, Long Distance Calling and Circus Maximus.</p>
<p>Rendezvous Point delivers a fierce and hard hitting energy bomb in the realm of progressive metal. With highly educated and skilled musicians, they are able to push the boundaries within the genre, creating a larger than life sounding experience for the listener as well as for themselves. With heavy drums, rumbling bass, raw guitars, large synthesizer sounds and powerful vocals, they explore new areas of the genre, daring to expand upon that which is already there. The band consists of Geirmund Hansen on vocals, Baard Kolstad on drums (Leprous), Petter Hallaråker on guitar, Nicolay Tangen Svennæs on keyboards (Ihsahn, Bernhoft, Emilie Nicolas) and Gunn-Hilde Erstad on bass.<br>
The epic arrangements of Rendezvous Point are truly one of a kind, and should really be experienced live.</p>
