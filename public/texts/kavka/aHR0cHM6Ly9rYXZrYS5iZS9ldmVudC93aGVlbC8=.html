<p><span>WHEEL</span></p>
<p><span>Charismatic leaders. These are the dictators, demagogues and false idols who, around the world at this very moment, are stoking division and igniting war in the name of nothing but self-gain. They’re also the unmistakable target of Wheel’s new album of the same name: a seven-song prog metal opus that strives for all things right in a world gone wrong.</span></p>
<p>MOLYBARON</p>
<p>Formed in Paris in 2015 by Dublin-born guitarist Gary Kelly, MOLYBARON are steadily earning themselves a reputation for thinking outside the box and defying expectations. Over the course of two subtly radical records, 2017’s self-titled debut and 2021’s acclaimed The Mutiny, this eclectic quartet have casually bent and broken all the usual rules of modern heaviness. In 2023, they returned with their third and most fervently diverse record to date, Something Ominous: further evidence that MOLYBARON are operating in a field of precisely one.</p>
