					<p>Stand Atlantic</p>

<p>Stand Atlantic crushed all expectations with their last album, f.e.a.r. Buoyed by the massive hit, “deathwish feat. nothing, nowhere.” (which has over 50M streams to date), Stand Atlantic broke into the Top 10 on the ARIA Australian charts and Top 20 on the US Billboard Top Albums chart. “switchblade” and the band received the coveted Feature Album at triple J for the new album and extensive BBC Radio 1 airplay. Having played across UK / Europe across some of the markets biggest festivals, Stand Atlantic are set to return in support of their new highly anticipated album “WAS HERE”, which will feature the likes of Sueco, PVRIS, Polaris and Bruses. Fraser says “This album feels like a rebirth in a sense. i went through a lot of huge emotional changes in my life throughout the process of writing and recording it and have written about things i have been too afraid to say out loud, let alone write about and have anyone in the world to have access to it. It feels like a whole new and improved version of us and even me personally. There is something for everyone on this record, just as there was the last.”</p>
