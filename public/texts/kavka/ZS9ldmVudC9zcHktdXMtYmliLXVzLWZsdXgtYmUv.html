     <em>MENDVILLE PRESENTS</em>

SPY (us)SPY is a five-piece hardcore punk band from the San Francisco Bay Area. Their chimeric tracks shift in an instant from rock and roll riffs to injure-somebody hardcore and back again, all over a distorted, dystopian backdrop. Nowhere is this more clear than on SATISFACTION, their debut LP, released on June 2nd, back in 2023, via Triple B Records. SPY formed out of the lightning in a bottle Bay Area DIY scene in 2020 and made an immediate impact with their SERVICE WEAPON EP, six minutes and forty-nine seconds of raw, distorted hardcore punk. The EP HABITUAL OFFENDER followed in 2021. Their LP release arrives amidst two consecutive years of US-EU touring, with no let-up in sight. The band recently signed to Closked Casket Activities, who will be taking care of their new record “Soon Enough”


BIB (us)In comes BIB. Noisey, blown out hardcore from the middle of nowhere. Following the “everything louder than everything else approach” to their demo, Bibs already colossal riffs sound like an avalanche when the bottom drops. Squirmy effected vocals veer their sound from huge to weird. Live, sometimes seen with 3 guitar players, Bib takes their wall of sound to a whole new level that will leave your eardrums vibrating.


FLUX (be)Sounding like a chronic toothache, Flux is a new fistpump clique fronted by the infamous Anneke Chips.Post-VERZET. Expect some short, political songs. Expect some familiar faces within the punkscene.

Be on time, you have been warned.
