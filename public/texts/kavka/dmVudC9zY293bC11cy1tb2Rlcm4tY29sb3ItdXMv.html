            <strong>SCOWL (us)</strong><br />
            Scowl has quickly made a name for themselves as one of the most
            vivid and hard-working acts in the rock world. Since the release of
            their debut album, How Flowers Grow in late 2021, the band has
            become a powerful force to be reckoned with. Lauded for its
            reality-driven, aggressive blend of hardcore-punk, the
            critically-acclaimed album opened up new doors for the band,
            including a non-stop touring schedule.<br />
            As new music began to take shape, it was no surprise that
            experiencing most of their lives on the road would greatly influence
            the next phase of Scowl.<br />
            In april 2025, the band will release their new album “Are We All
            Angels” which they will promote across Europe in May.

            <strong>MODERN COLOR (us)</strong><br />
            Modern Color is a melodic rock band from Southern California
            blending influences from the hardcore and indie scenes into a unique
            sound. Their music features heavy shoegaze elements and draws
            comparisons to bands like Title Fight and Superheaven with loud
            guitars and emotionally charged melodies.
