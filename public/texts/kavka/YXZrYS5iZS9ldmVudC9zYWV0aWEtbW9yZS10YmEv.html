            SAETIA (us)<br class="html-br" />formed in 1997 in New York City and
            only existed until 1999. During over two decades of inactivity, the
            band’s music took on a life of its own, cultivating a large
            international fanbase and is broadly acknowledged as massively
            influential in the DIY emo hardcore universe. In 2016, the band
            released a double album discography via Jeremy Bolm’s (Touché Amoré)
            Secret Voice Records. This project reignited the band’s interest in
            playing music, and 6 years later, in November of 2022, the band
            played 5 sold out shows in NYC and Philadelphia. The response was
            overwhelming, and the shows raised $31K for local charities
            defending trans rights and protecting abortion access. By January
            2023, the band had booked additional benefit shows in California,
            two shows in England, and a festival appearance in Florida at Fest.
            The band has since continued to tour all over the U.S. in 2024 and
            looks to play more shows overseas in 2025. To date, SAETIA has
            raised over $67K for local organizations.
