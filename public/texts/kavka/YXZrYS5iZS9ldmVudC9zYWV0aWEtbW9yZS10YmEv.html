     <p>SAETIA (us)formed in 1997 in New York City and only existed until 1999. During over two decades of inactivity, the band’s music took on a life of its own, cultivating a large international fanbase and is broadly acknowledged as massively influential in the DIY emo hardcore universe. In 2016, the band released a double album discography via Jeremy Bolm’s (Touché Amoré) Secret Voice Records. This project reignited the band’s interest in playing music, and 6 years later, in November of 2022, the band played 5 sold out shows in NYC and Philadelphia. The response was overwhelming, and the shows raised $31K for local charities defending trans rights and protecting abortion access. By January 2023, the band had booked additional benefit shows in California, two shows in England, and a festival appearance in Florida at Fest. The band has since continued to tour all over the U.S. in 2024 and looks to play more shows overseas in 2025. To date, SAETIA has raised over $67K for local organizations.</p>
<p>SIEM REAP (be)The solo project of Gilles Demolder (Oathbreaker/Wiegedood). Over the past 3 years he’s been silently working on a new sound. After what seemed like a lifetime of trial and error, throwing away song after song &amp; a lot of endless nights of recording, Siem Reap arose. The main focus of Siem Reap is to be an outlet of daily thoughts &amp; frustrations, coping with masculinity, alcoholism, family &amp; relationships.The live segment of Siem Reap will be accompanied by Wim Coppers (Wiegedood), Jasper Hollevoet (Sunflower, Ventilateur) &amp; Filip Brans (Dogpeople).</p>
