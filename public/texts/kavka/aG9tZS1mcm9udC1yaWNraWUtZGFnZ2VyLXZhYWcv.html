					<p>HOME FRONT (can)<br>
Enormous full length debut, Game Of Power, from Home Front who have managed to fix truth to the beautiful and borderline mythical threadneedle moment in which punk, new wave, pop, indie and rock and roll all descend upon a single source. We may have only dreamed that Tears for Fears might have been going to see GBH at the weekend or that Annie Lennox spent her evening sewing Crass patches to her Wrangler Blue Bell jacket, but Home Front have rang the dinner triangle for us all to feast. High moments of perfectly patina’d synth brilliance, tender new wave considerations, punk anthems that could fill the biggest stadium, and fiery hooks that could warm the coldest cynic. The Champagne, the gluebag, the boots, and the eyeliner, GAMES OF POWER clutches to it all.<br>
GAMES OF POWER lives inside a crystal clear recording by long time friend and Edmonton wizard Nik Kozub, bringing Home Front’s follow up to “Think of The Lie” to euphoric heights and gritty lows. Produced again by Jonah Falco with co production by Nik Kozub, Home Front have put their best mirror shined foot forward.<br>

<p>RICHIE DAGGER (nl)<br>
Richie Dagger arose from the ashes of the psychedelic outfit Hooghwater &amp; Dutch / Belgium Punks the Reactionaries.<br>
This collaboration of members of the aforementioned bands was not new. Most of them already played together in Hardcore Punk Powerhouse: Restless Youth.<br>
Get ready for a mix of (Post)Punk &amp; Wave with their own weird dark approach! After a small or big hiatus, depending on how you view time and space, the (old) boys are back with a fourth full length album.<br>
