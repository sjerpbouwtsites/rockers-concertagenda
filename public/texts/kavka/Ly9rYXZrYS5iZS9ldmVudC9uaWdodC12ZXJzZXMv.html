     <p>Hailing from Fullerton, CA, NIGHT VERSES, comprising drummer Aric Improta, guitarist Nick DePirro, and bassist Reilly Herrera—has gained recognition for their intense live performances and innovative songwriting. Night Verses first galvanized listeners with their 2012 EP! Out Of The Sky”, merging prog, alt-metal, postrock and ambient electronica into their own intoxicating strain of cinematic metal. They continued to hone their bold songwriting and genre-bending musicianship on their debut full-length, 2014″s !Lift Your Existence”. After the mass critical acclaim that followed, they returned in 2016 with the fulllength !Into The Vanishing Light” produced by legendary producer Ross Robinson (Slipknot, At The Drive In). The album was the band”s first release after signing with Equal Vision Records, and marked their last album with a vocalist.</p>
<p>The band released their first instrumental album in 2018, with the critically acclaimed !From The Gallery Of Sleep”, which cemented them as fearless, genre-defying innovators. Dubbed “The Salvador Dali of progmetal” by Noisey / Vice, the album was hailed as “boundary-breaking prog” (Revolver), “ambitious and creative” (Exclaim!) and “a layered prog masterpiece” (Distorted Sound). Their latest album, Every Sound Has a Color in the Valley of Night, has been met with critical and fan acclaim, solidifying their place at the forefront of the progressive music scene. With well over 20 million career streams and unanimously glowing praise for their first five releases, the stage is set for NIGHT VERSES to ascend to even greater heights.</p>
