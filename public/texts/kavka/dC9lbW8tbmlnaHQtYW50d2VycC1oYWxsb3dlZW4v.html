					<p>By now, we all know that we can‚Äôt let Halloween pass us by without hosting an Emo Night where are all you sad &amp; spooky freaks can gather, right?! We‚Äôve got your covered! Maybe digging up your skinny jeans, studded belt and checkered Vans from the back of your closet feels like enough of a creepy costume to you, or maybe you wanna go all out and bring out the fake blood and colored contacts. Either way, we can‚Äôt wait to welcome you again on the 31st of October at Kavka Oudaan!</p>
<p>What can you expect?!<br>
As always, our DJs will treat you to the saddest tunes from the 90‚Äôs through today. Occasionally throwing in some nu metal, pop or other genres in the mix, but we mostly stay true to our emo roots. ü§òüèª</p>
<p>For fans of:<br>
Taking Back Sunday, Fall Out Boy, Panic! @ The Disco, Brand New, Paramore, From First To Last, Hawthorne Heights, Jimmy Eat World, Escape The Fate, All Time Low, Thrice, My Chemical Romance, Silverstein, Underoath, Dashboard Confessional, AFI, The Used, BlessTheFall, Blink-182, Senses Fail, Good Charlotte, Limp Bizkit and MANY MANY MORE!<br>
Tickets will go on sale this Friday the 13th of September at 4 PM!</p>
