					<p>Mendville x Flood Floorshows present</p>
<p>SEEYOUSPACECOWBOY (us)<br>
Showcasing their new record “Coup de Grâce”: an album in the truest sense of the word. Wholeheartedly ambitious, it’s a graphic novel in musical form that not only succeeds in creating its own deliciously dark, noir universe, but one whose characters truly inhabit the world that SeeYouSpaceCowboy have invented for them.</p>
<p>BONEFLOWER (esp)</p>
<p>KILLING ME SOFTLY (uk)<br>
As seen at “This is Eurocore” in Ghent.<br>
This band has quickly gained some following after their 2 releases from 2023. In their short existence, the band had the opportunity to support bands such as Kaonashi and Static Dress. Their nostalgic sound is a perfect fit with Seeyouspacecowboy. Brace yourself for some early 2010’ish hardcore/metalcore vibes.</p>
<p>Location:<br>
