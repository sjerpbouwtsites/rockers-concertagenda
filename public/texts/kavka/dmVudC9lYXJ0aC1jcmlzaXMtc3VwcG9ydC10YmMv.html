     <p>Earth Crisis is an American metallic hardcore band from Syracuse, New York, active from 1989 until 2001, reuniting in 2007. The band has released eight full-length studio albums and four studio EPs, among other releases. The band is known for supporting animal rights, promoting a straight edge and vegan lifestyle, and addressing further social and political issues. Earth Crisis is considered a crucial developer and influence for both the metalcore genre and vegan straight edge movement.</p>

<p>INITIATE (us)
Initiate is a SoCal-based that cooks up hardcore that has a lot to love about it. It’s moshy, fast, angry-sounding, and just when you least expect it to be, melodic. “The band’s sound is honestly difficult to sum up in simply one description,” guitarist Alec tells No Echo. “I think there are many differing a aspects of music that embody Initiate, but I guess the one underlying theme is that there’s always a sense of melody despite whether it’s fast or heavy. We all love lots of different varied music that I think adds to an interesting conglomerate for our sound.”</p>

<p>VISCERAL CONTEMPT (nl)After Human Demise disbanded in 2012 vocalist Maurice and Guitar player Willem stayed in touch. Two years ago Willem created three old school Metalcore tracks and using the Operation Oyster concept (the allied forces bombings on the Philips factories in Eindhoven) as input Maurice wrote the lyrics. Victor from Dark Intentions/Pigteeth stepped in as drummer and the first demo “The Raid” was created. Winter 2024 the first demo was released and Johan (ex- No Turning Back) stepped in on bass. The first shows have been played and new songs are written in the style of Ringworm, Kickback and All Out War. Expect heavy &amp; groovy metalcore with vicious vocals the old way.</p>
