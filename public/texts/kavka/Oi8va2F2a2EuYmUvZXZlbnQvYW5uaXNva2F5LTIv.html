                headline tour in the band’s<br />
                history, continuing their acclaimed Abyss Tour and presenting
                Abyss Pt. II.<br />
                After playing over 20 shows across the continent in 2023—many of
                them sold out—and<br />
                supporting Within Temptation as a main support in arenas
                throughout 2024, the band is<br />
                now taking the next step: 30 shows in 14 countries across all
                over Europe !
