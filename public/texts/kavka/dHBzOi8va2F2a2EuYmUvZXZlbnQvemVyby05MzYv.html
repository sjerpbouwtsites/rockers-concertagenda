					<p>Siphoning precise raps through a battlefield of distorted guitars and glitchy hues, Zero 9:36 holds up a mirror in his music and beckons reflection. The Philadelphia post-genre sonic insurgent, singer, creative, and rapper rhymes with the force and fire of a prizefighter. After grinding under-the-radar for years and augmenting his signature style with frequent collaborator and producer No Love For The Middle Child, he was signed as the flagship act of ATCO Records. Powered by highlights such as “Leave The Light On” and “WWYDF,” the You Will Not Be Saved EP introduced him while generating 70 million-plus streams.</p>
<p>On its heels, he joined forces with grandson on “Again (Text Voter XX to 40649)” in addition to dropping the acoustic Barebones Vol. 1 EP in 2020.

The single “Adrenaline” hit #1 on Mediabase’s Active Rock airplay chart and stands as the #2 most played at the format that year. Zero toured hard and continued releasing steady hits on an endless tour cycle. Tracks like “Stuck In My Ways”, “Break Ft. Atreyu”, and “I’m Not” caught listeners’ ears live and brought them into his world. Upon release, Loudwire raved, “‘I’m Not’ is a banger with Zero 9:36’s nimble lyrical flow playing out over tribal drums and a wall of guitars and electronic backing.” Zero’s latest releases “IFelt It All” and “The Fear” have become fan favorites and mainstays on stations like SiriusXM Octane.</p>
