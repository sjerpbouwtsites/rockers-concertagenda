<p>We’re excited to have ASOMVEL back at Little Devil!</p>
<h3>Asomvel</h3>
<p>ASOMVEL are a four-piece hard rock band from the U.K., notorious for excessive volume, and high-octane stage shows.</p>
<p>Barely a year after ASOMVEL released their well-respected debut LP, Kamikaze, the band was shaken to its core when front-man, Jay-Jay Winter, was killed in a road accident.</p>
<p>Although a devastating tragedy, co-founding guitarist, Lenny, knew that the band had to continue in tribute to the determined spirit of their founder.</p>
<p>Since releasing World Shaker, the first album with Jay-Jay’s nephew, Ralph, on vocals, the band has performed around the world; including a tour of South America, Japan, and all around Europe. These dates included many well-respected festivals and lengthy tours with well-established artists.</p>
<p>ASOMVEL are set to release their definitive album, ‘Born to Rock ‘n’ Roll’ on March 29th,<br>
following a year of tremendous growth with their music reaching new fans around the world, due to their incredible social media presence.<br>
The new album will be followed by extensive touring, bringing their electrifying stage show<br>
to an army of hungry fans!</p>
