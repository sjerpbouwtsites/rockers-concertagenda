<p>Sons of Node is a three piece sludgy band based in Utrecht, The Netherlands. They are known for their foul &amp; dissonant riffage combined with a bass sound as huge as a mammoth, backed by massive “brick in your face” drums. All three of the hairy bastards top it off with their vocals, each one of them with their own style and sound.
