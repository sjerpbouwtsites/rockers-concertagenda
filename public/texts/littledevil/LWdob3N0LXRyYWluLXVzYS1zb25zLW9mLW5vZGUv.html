                    time for the very last time as the band is going to call it
                    quits. The American band is known for their blistering mix
                    of stoner rock, blues and heavy rock. It is one of the best
                    live bands in recent decades.</b

                Sons of Node is a three piece sludgy band based in Utrecht, The
                Netherlands. They are known for their foul &amp; dissonant
                riffage combined with a bass sound as huge as a mammoth, backed
                by massive “brick in your face” drums. All three of the hairy
                bastards top it off with their vocals, each one of them with
                their own style and sound.<br />
