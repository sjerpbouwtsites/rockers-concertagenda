            <h3>Ggu:ll</h3>
            <p>
                Ggu:ll is the vessel of the lost. A means of staring into the
                empty sockets of suffering. Enduring the lack of meaning and
                ground. Enduring defeat and loss. Riffs are very basic yet
                eloquent and add plots and nuances to the great narratives the
                drums and bass dictate.
            </p>

                Ggu:ll is a four-piece blackened doom band from Tilburg, The
                Netherlands, formed in 2009. They originated from the chaos of
                noise and kept adding the deep layers and combined with doom.
                This resulted in their debut album ‘Dwaling’ released in 2016 on
                Ván records. The album gained international recognition, leading
                to shows at Roadburn, Le guess who?, Neurotic Deathfest,
                Archerontic Arts, Soul Crusher. Sharing the stage with bands
                like Bongripper, Primitive Man and Inter Arma.

                For their new record ‘Ex Est’ Ggu:ll extracted the coldness of
                black metal and added that to the mix. In 7 songs, they present
                a wide spectrum of heavy intense music. Shifting from blackened
                doom, to heavy psychedelica back to noise infused torture
                drones.
            </p>
            <p>
                The album title ‘Ex Est’ refers to the state after being. The
                realization that all that is, will some day not be. All is
                doomed to end up as a ruin of itself. Herein lies the search for
                meaning in existence, despite the realization that life itself
                is meaningless. Artist Manuel Tinnemans visualized this theme in
                the exclusive cover art accompanying this release.

                Ex Est was released by Consouling Sounds on October 21st 2022 on
                colored vinyl and cd.
