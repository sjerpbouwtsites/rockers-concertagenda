    <p>21.00 | psychedelic heavy rock | 12,50</p>
<p> California psychedelic heavy rock champions SACRI MONTI blaze a scorching trail of superb shredding and smoldering riff-o-rama on their Tee Pee Records debut.</p>
<p>Formed in San Diego in 2012, Sacri Monti has transcended genres and sonic expectations to create a sound so unique, their name has become synonymous with invention. Signed to Tee Pee Records, this July will see the official release of their third studio album, Retrieval. New single and album opener ‘Maelstrom’ hits like a whirling 70s prog rock opus, recalling the chugging riff/organ fuelled majesty of Machine Head-era Deep Purple, alongside the Space Ritual vibes of Hawkwind. There’s no question that Sacri Monti has upped their game on this one and we highly advise you to do the same.</p>
